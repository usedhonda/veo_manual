  "prompt": "A retro fantasy illustration in an Art Nouveau influenced style, rendered with flat muted colors and thick defined outlines reminiscent of Japanese woodblock prints. A lone woman in profile view, gazing upwards with a gentle expression, wearing a long flowing elegant white gown with gathered fabric, hair styled in a neat bun adorned with a white floral hairpiece. She holds a single white lily gracefully in her hands. She stands before a sprawling fantasy castle with numerous pointed turrets and blue conical roofs perched precariously on a rugged rocky cliff edge. Stylized clouds drift around the cliff. In the background are majestic layered mountain ranges and a colossal flat circular sun/moon disk dominating the beige sky behind the castle. Sepia tone atmosphere, highly detailed line work.",
