## Combining Camera with Shot Type

### Effective Combinations
```
"wide shot, slow dolly in" ✅
"close-up, static" ✅
"medium shot, tracking" ✅
"establishing shot, crane up" ✅
"over the shoulder, static" ✅
```

### Avoid These Combinations
```
"wide shot, fast zoom while panning" ❌ (too complex)
"close-up, rapid orbit" ❌ (disorienting)
"tracking while tilting and zooming" ❌ (multiple movements)
```

## Golden Rules

1. **One Movement Per Clip**: Don't combine pan + dolly + zoom
2. **Slow is Safe**: "Slow dolly" > "fast dolly" for reliability
3. **Specify Direction**: "pan left" > just "pan"
4. **Match Movement to Content**: Action scenes = tracking; dialogue = static
5. **Test with Fast Model**: Iterate camera on veo-3.1-fast before final render
