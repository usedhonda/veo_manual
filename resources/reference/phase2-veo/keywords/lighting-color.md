## Best Practices

1. **Match lighting to scene mood**: Horror = low key, Comedy = high key
2. **Be specific about direction**: "Backlit from upper right" > just "backlit"
3. **Combine lighting with color**: "Golden hour warm tones" reinforces the look
4. **Use film stock for consistency**: "Shot on Kodak Portra 400" gives consistent color
5. **One dominant light source**: Avoid conflicting multiple main sources
