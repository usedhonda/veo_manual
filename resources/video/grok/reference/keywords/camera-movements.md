## Professional Cinema Techniques

| Keyword | Technical Definition | Visual Effect | Best Use Case |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Dolly Zoom** | Zoom in while moving camera back (or vice versa) | Background expands/compresses while subject stays static (Vertigo effect) | Realization, shock, psychological tension |
| **Truck Left/Right** | Lateral camera movement perpendicular to subject | Background moves in parallax | Walking scenes, side-scrollers, vehicle tracking |
| **Pedestal Up/Down** | Vertical camera movement (elevator motion) | Reveals height, moves from feet to face | Establishing scale of buildings or monsters |
| **Dutch Angle** | Tilted horizon line (camera rolled) | Creates unease, disorientation | Chaos, villains, psychological distress |
| **Arc Shot** | Camera moves in arc around subject | Shows subject from multiple angles | Hero moments, dramatic reveals |
| **Crash Zoom** | Extremely fast zoom in | Sudden impact, surprise | Action comedy, kung-fu impact, sudden realization |
| **Whip Pan** | Very fast horizontal pan | Motion blur, scene transition | Action sequences, comedic timing |
| **Rack Focus** | Focus shifts from foreground to background | Directs viewer attention | Dialogue scenes, reveal techniques |

### Dolly Zoom Example
```
Camera executes dolly zoom: zooming in while physically moving backward,
creating the classic Vertigo effect as the background warps around the
stationary subject's terrified face.
```

### Dutch Angle Example
```
Dutch angle shot, horizon tilted 15 degrees, creating sense of unease
as the villain emerges from shadows.
```

### Crash Zoom Example
```
Sudden crash zoom into character's eyes at the moment of realization,
accompanied by dramatic sound sting.
```

## Best Practices

1. **One primary movement** per shot - avoid combining pan + zoom + dolly
2. **Match movement to mood** - slow for emotional, fast for energetic
3. **Front-load camera direction** - mention movement early in prompt
4. **Use lens terminology** for specific looks
5. **Specify speed** when precision matters

corners, weaving between obstacles at high speed, motion blur on edges.
