## Style Application Rules

1. **One primary medium**: Choose live action OR anime OR 3D, not multiple
2. **Era consistency**: Don't mix incompatible time periods
3. **Reference sparingly**: One director/film reference is enough
4. **Match style to content**: Horror content needs horror aesthetics
5. **Commercial clarity**: Product videos need clean, professional styles
